% Patel-Schneider, of AT\&T Bell Laboratories collaborated on their
% preparation.

% These instructions can be modified and used in other conferences as long
% as credit to the authors and supporting agencies is retained, this notice
% is not changed, and further modification or reuse is not restricted.
% Neither Shirley Jowell nor Peter F. Patel-Schneider can be listed as
% contacts for providing assistance without their prior permission.

% To use for other conferences, change references to files and the
% conference appropriate and use other authors, contacts, publishers, and

% page charge instructions.
